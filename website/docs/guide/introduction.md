# What is Karaetor

This project aims to design standards for creating and consuming karaoke instructions to be used publicly and freely.

This project contains the standard definition of the data structure describing a karaoke clip as well as several tools and apps for references.

The `ksml` data-structure is portable and can be easily created and imported from and to karaetor-compliant platforms.

This is an early work in progress and currently being built on my free time, so bear with me
